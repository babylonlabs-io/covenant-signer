# There are two btc related configs
# 1. [btc-config] is config for btc full node which should have transaction indexing
# enabled. This node should be synced and can be open to the public.
# 2. [btc-signer-config] is config for bitcoind daemon which should have only
# wallet functionality, it should run in separate network. This bitcoind instance
# will be used to sign psbt's
