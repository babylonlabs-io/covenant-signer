# Covenant Signer

The covenant signer is a standalone program operating a server
that accepts requests for signing transactions that require covenant emulation.
It is operated by members of the covenant emulation committee and
accessed to collect signatures of Bitcoin Staking on-demand unbonding
transactions.

## Background

The Bitcoin Staking protocol introduces the ability for Bitcoin holders to lock
their Bitcoin in a self-custodial Bitcoin Staking Script in order to get voting
power in a Bitcoin secured PoS protocol.
Among others, the
[Bitcoin Staking Script](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/v0.8.5/docs/staking-script.md)
involves a pre-defined timelock for which the stake remains active.
To enable a user experience comparable to typical PoS systems,
the script allows for the stake to be on-demand unlocked prior to the timelock
expiration. However, due to the limited expressiveness of the Bitcoin scripting
language, a covenant emulation committee is required to co-sign unbonding
transactions in order to ensure that the stake is unlocked in a protocol
compliant way. More specifically, the covenant emulation committee is
responsible for verifying on-demand unbonding transactions and if they are
valid, providing its signatures for them.
If a quorum of the members of the covenant emulation committee provide their
signatures, then the on-demand unbonding transaction is fully signed and can be
propagated to the network. More details on the need for covenants and the
covenant committee can be found
[here](https://github.com/babylonchain/covenant-emulator/blob/v0.1.0/README.md).

## Covenant Signer Server Architecture

### Requirements

The design of the covenant signer server is guided by the following
requirements:
- *High Availability*: The signers should be highly available as unbonding
  requests may arrive at any time.
- *Secure Storage of Keys*: The private key of the covenant emulator committee
  member should be encrypted when stored on disk to mitigate the risk of theft.
- *Backed up Keys*: The private key of the covenant emulator committee member
  should be easy to back-up to mitigate the risk of loss.

### Prior Work

The covenant signer server design is based on the following documents:
- [Bitcoind: Managing the Wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md)
- [Bitcoind: Offline Signing Tutorial](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/offline-signing-tutorial.md)
- [Lightning: Remote Signing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/remote-signing.md)

### Architecture

![architecture](/docs/architecture.png)

To fulfill the above requirements, the covenant signer server has been designed
to consist of the following components:
- *Bitcoind instance in wallet mode* - a bitcoind instance that stores the
  covenant emulator committee member's key. This instance should be located in
  a secure network and only allow connections from the signing server
  component. Bitcoind was chosen as the signing-backend as it is an easy-to-use
  and open source software which has been heavily tested in adversarial
  environments.
- *Bitcoind instance* - a bitcoind full node instance that is used to validate
  that incoming unbonding requests are about staking transactions that have
  been observed and confirmed by the Bitcoin ledger. This can be the same as
  the bitcoind instance in wallet mode or a separate instance to maintain the
  connectivity of the wallet at a minimal level. For production environments,
  we recommend that they are separate instances.
- *Signing Server* - functions as a server receiving signing requests. It has
  no access to the private key and it is connected to the internet.

> Note: The covenant-signer server is a sibling program of the [covenant
> emulator](https://github.com/babylonchain/covenant-emulator). The main
> difference between the two programs is that the covenant-signer functions as
> a server accepting signing requests, while the covenant-emulator functions as
> a daemon reading for transactions that are pending covenant signatures from a
> Babylon node. The covenant-signer is used in systems in which there is no
> underlying Babylon chain to read from.

## Security Features

### HMAC Authentication

The covenant signer implements HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) authentication to 
ensure that only authorized clients can request signatures. This prevents unauthorized 
signature requests from potentially malicious actors.

#### Configuration

HMAC authentication is configured via the server configuration in the covenant signer's 
configuration file:

```toml
[server-config]
# ... other server configuration options ...

# HMAC key for request authentication
# Leave empty to disable HMAC authentication
hmac-key = "your-secure-random-key"
```

The HMAC key should be:
- A strong, randomly generated secret
- Shared between the covenant emulator and covenant signer
- Kept secure and confidential
- Changed periodically according to your security policies

You can generate a secure random key with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

#### Client Usage

When making requests to the covenant signer, clients must include an HMAC signature 
in the `X-Covenant-HMAC` HTTP header. The HMAC is calculated using SHA-256 over the 
complete request body, using the shared secret key.

#### Security Considerations

- **Key Secrecy**: The HMAC key must be kept confidential. Compromise of this key would 
  allow an attacker to forge valid signature requests.
  
- **Constant-Time Comparison**: The implementation uses constant-time comparison to prevent 
  timing attacks.

## Participation in the Committee

Participating in the covenant emulation committee requires:
1. The inclusion of the covenant emulator committee member's public key in the
   global parameters set. The global parameters set contains values that
   specify what constitutes a valid staking transaction, including the covenant
   committee members the staking transaction should contain. These parameters
   are required to be set prior to the network launch.
2. Covenant committee members setting up their covenant signer program to
   consume from the global parameters and publishing the address in which the
   covenant signer server listens to. The covenant signer needs to be available
   to sign requests at the moment of the network launch.

### Network Launch Ceremony

The network launch ceremony involves the coordination between the participants
of the covenant emulation committee to construct a commonly shared list of
covenant emulation committee participants inside the global system parameters.

It involves the following steps:
1. *Keys Generation*: Covenant emulation committee participants
   generate and publish their covenant emulator Bitcoin public keys.
2. *Covenants List Construction*: All public keys are included
   in the global parameters which are shared with the public and the
   committee participants.
3. *Network Launch*: The committee members set up and launch their covenant
   signer program with the specified parameters prior to the network launch.
   They share the address their server listens to for incoming requests, so
   that on network launch such requests can be routed to their servers.

The [deployment guide](/docs/deployment.md), covers the details on how to set
up all the required components. For the *Keys Generation* part of the ceremony,
only the offline bitcoind wallet is required in order to create the BTC public
key (Sections 2 and 3 of the guide).
After that, once the *Covenants List Construction* is completed,
the full bitcoind node (Section 2) and the covenant signer (Section 4) can be
set up.
